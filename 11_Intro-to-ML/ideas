Basic regression and classification, sklearn, lin alg resources
I'd recommend stealing/borrowing/modifying some parts of the exercises/lectures from the ChBE6745 course

I think it may also make sense to tailor the exercises/examples to what is currently done in the group. I.e.,
regressing "formation" energies, KINNs (with a basic example from Dingqi/Gabriel), and on-the-fly. I'm (LRT)
still doing some work with AMPTorch as is Nicole I believe, but I'm not sure how much of a focus that will be
in the future in terms of ML development or incorporating into workflows. Thus, I'd reframe this section and the
final two to be more focused on KINNs, on-the-fly, and practical ML that we all use day-to-day.
