    "So far, we have learnt about the parameters that need to be specified in a DFT calculation but we haven't looked at the details of the standard procedure of choosing these parameters. As we know that solving Kohn-Sham (KS) equations require multiple iterations with an initial guess of electron density, when we run DFT calculations, we always need to verify if the calculations have converged. In a \"well-converged\" calculation, the solution should accurately approximate the true solution of the mathematical formulation of the KS-DFT equations. In this lesson, we will learn about that is needed to perform a well-converged DFT calculation. "
